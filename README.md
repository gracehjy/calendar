# phpMyAdmin
- username: gracehjy
- password: Luzr_5462
- database: module5
- tables created: events, tags, user_information

# Required Functionality
- users can log in or create an account if they don't have one
- unregistered users can only see a calendar (no events displayed)
- registered users can add events and click on an event to view its details (event details include title, date, times, and tags)
- registered users can also edit, delete any events they created (go to profile -> view all events)

# Creative Portion
- users can add tags to events (once a tag is created it is saved to their account; users can reuse tags previously created)
- users can share events with other users
- users have the option to change their username (every user has a unique username)
- users can delete their account which would delete any event (shared or not) associated with them
- user registration (not on rubric)
- events show up on calendar (not on rubric)
